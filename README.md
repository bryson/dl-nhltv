## On Linux
On Linux this should be rather easy. Havent tried. Only painfull thing could be the python version.
You need python 2.7 or higher. Might want to try 3 as some distries have 2.6 its apparently easier with python3

### Debian based

#### Install aria2c and ffmpeg
```
sudo apt-get install aria2 ffmpeg
```
For some distributions install ffmpeg follow howto of your choice like

https://www.assetbank.co.uk/support/documentation/install/ffmpeg-debian-squeeze/ffmpeg-debian-jessie/


### Red Hat based
note: havent tried this pure guesswork RHEL likes its python2.6 as its system version so you need to keep that.

1) install aria2
```
sudo yum install aria2 ffmpeg
```
For some distributions install ffmpeg follow howto of your choice like

https://www.assetbank.co.uk/support/documentation/install/ffmpeg-debian-squeeze/ffmpeg-debian-jessie/

### Docker
If you want to build a docker image have a look at the docker file and docker compose examples. The docker compose example is made for docker swarm, so you have to modify it for a single docker installation.

## Run dl-nhltv
BEWARE ! This early version stores settings.json and temporary files in the folder you run it from!
Temporary files can exceed 5GB on your drive you want at least 10GB free space!
Best is to have a folder per team line to run the command in like $HOME/NHL/Detroit /$HOME/NHL/Capitals etc..

* Press Command+Space and type Terminal and press enter/return key.
* Run in Terminal app
```
nhltv -t Detroit
```

# How dl-nhltv works 
When it runs it will check the nhl.tv servers for a new game for your team and if it finds it then it will download it. Then after it downloads it will do a loop and start looking for the next game. It saves the id of the last game in settings.json in the folder you ran it from so if you aren't getting the results you expect then take a look at the settings.json file and set the game id manually to be lower than the gameid you want to download. It also saves the username and password in the settings.json file when you pass it in via -u -p. Otherwise it will ask when the cookies run old.

# Files and folders
dl-nhltv downloads the parts of a stream into a temp/ subfolder below the folder you started from.
Per game you have a different log file for the download.
You can watch the progress of the download by looking into the temp folder.
